          APIOps Values – APIOps values are effectively captured in  the Agile Manifesto. APIOps extends the “People over Process over Tools,” and urges API developer  +  system operator + 3rd party service developer collaboration.
          APIOps Principles  – APIOps at the conceptual level is based on Agile’s and DevOps  principles to focus on effective collaborative design, development and  maintenance of APIs to enable extremely fast and flexible service design  and development.
          APIOps Methods  – You can use Scrum or Kanban with operations.  Provide methods to collaboratively design APIs for service development  utilizing the principles of design first approach.
          APIOps Practices  – Provide low barrier access to reliable APIs, documentation supporting  usage, sandboxes to test and build on top of, generated libraries and  code examples for service developers.
          APIOps Tools  – Tools you’d use in the commission of these principles. Identifying business value from API, you should use API Canvas Model. In the APIOps  world there’s a lot of  emerging tools and evolving standards in  provisioning (docker, vagrant), design (RAML, API Blueprint, Swagger),  API server code generation (Drakov ), generating OS specific libraries (APIMATIC ), managing APIs (apinf.com, 3scale.com,) and many more.
