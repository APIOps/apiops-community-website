        <p style="font-size:16px;">
          Standardization is about conformity, harmonization is about consistency. Both are needed in #API Economy and supported by APIOps. Harmonization cuts costs in integration and development, enables lower  learning curve for the API consumers, creates stability and increases  security, and enables automatisation in large scale API -driven systems. In other words we are talking about API orchestration and life cycle management, enabling seamless API networks.
        </p>

        <blockquote style="margin-top:2em; margin-bottom:2em;">APIOps is a way of thinking. It contains two elements: tech savvy business professionals who create API -strategy (APItalist) and developers who utilize automation (devops practices) in API life cycle management. </blockquote>

        <p style="font-size:16px;">Even though APItalists and APIOps developers are often different persons, they form a team which work in co-operation with the API consumers (3rd party developers). APItalist is the person responsible for API -strategy and has business value creation capabilities. API -strategy needs to be implemented and in that process APItalist uses API Model Canvas, which resembles  Lean Canvas, but is  focused on APIs. Canvas helps in identifying developers to reach out, business values, resources needed and inflow metrics. APIOps developers can rely on cocreated API Model Canvas  when putting it in code and automating API life cycle management with help of Design languages such as Swagger and RAML.</p>
